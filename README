Seductively Efficient Xenophilic Intelligent Translator of objective-c to ruby
==============================================================================


prereq
======
% brew install swi-prolog

it needs to be 6.x for apply:foldl


make targets
============

% make          # compiles to exec, entry point: main/1
% make run      # as above plus runs the exec
% make test     # loads code, runs tests and exits
% make repl     # loads code, runs repl/1 hook and stays in the repl

By the way, don't strip exec -- it will purge our code and leave only
the swipl kernel.

SEXIT
=====
Seductively Efficient Xenophilic Intelligent Translator of objective-c to ruby.
You can use it by hitting a key on a selected region in Sublime2 editor.

install
=======
1. % brew install swi-prolog   # needs to be 6.x for apply:foldl
2. % make install
3. have Sublime2
4. put  { "keys": ["super+q"], "command":"sex" }  into your Sublime key bindings
5. hit cmd-q
6. enjoy


make targets
============

% make install  # compiles & installs as Sublime2 plugin
% make          # compiles to exec, entry point: main/1
% make run      # as above plus runs the exec
% make test     # loads code, runs tests and exits
% make repl     # loads code, runs repl/1 hook and stays in the repl

By the way, don't strip exec -- it will purge our code and leave only
the swipl kernel.

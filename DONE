important
=========

+ translate parse tree to ruby
+ stdin/stdout runner
+ handle multilines and guess lines layout
+ accept multilines as well as expressions from the middle of the line
+ trim ending whitespaces before parsing
+ Sublime2 plugin
+ insanely simple error handling when there's no sex (does not parse)
+ @-string literals
+ string literals consisting of a number
+ letters at the end of num literals
+ bool literals YES NO
+ NULL -> nil
+ simple var type decls in assign statements
+ ignore casts in values
+ normal function calls
+ lambdas
+ allow += -= assignments
= keep original indentation and put all output lines with it
- keep original number of newlines at the end
- method decls
- _variable -> @variable

less prio
=========
- remove .autorelease .release with comment to assign nil
- less nondeterminism
- BUG with exp.attr when input contains doublequoted semicolon
- potential BUG with decision on exp vs code_block 
- super exception
- ignore var decls
- array subscripts
= container exprs:
  = array @[e1,e2]  -- parsed, anyway occurs only twice in Pablo's 
  - dict @{ @"k1": e1, @"k2": e2 }  -- occurs only twice in Pablo's
= @selector(..) syntax
  - give me the cases Royal:
    + action:@selector(fire:)  --> action:"fire"
    what about other arities?
- flow control
  - if
  - switch - maybe
  -- for - no, better use ruby iteration
- comments
- ifdefs
- string literals having \" inside
- enums
- enhanced bool literals @TRUE @FALSE
- @property -> outlet or commented outlet
- @'Z' literals
- boxing expressions @(expr)
- arith
- op++ op-- only as statements
- tests in separate file (load_test_files/1, use_module/1? ..etc)
- plugin: when can't find binary it doesn't show any error 
  and reads empty string  which is passed to editor, causing 
  disappearance of the text in region
- messages with variable argument list

maybe
=====
- idents as atoms

rejected
========
- continuous i/o runner - doesn't buy us anything
- save original lines layout
- translate to "iolist" and write properly at the postprocessing


symbols
=======
+ DONE
- TODO
= WIP

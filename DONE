important
=========

+ translate parse tree to ruby
+ stdin/stdout runner
+ handle multilines and guess lines layout
+ accept multilines as well as expressions from the middle of the line
+ trim ending whitespaces before parsing
+ Sublime2 plugin
- error handling (couldn't parse -> return back original buffer or some error text)
- normal function calls
- normal syntax constructs
- comments
- super exception

less prio
=========

- tests in separate file (load_test_files/1, use_module/1? ..etc)
- save original lines layout
- idents as atoms
- translate to "iolist" and write properly at the postprocessing

rejected
========
- continuous i/o runner - doesn't buy us anything
